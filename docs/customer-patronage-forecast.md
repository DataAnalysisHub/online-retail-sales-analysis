# Customer Patronage Forecast Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer patronage data using time series forecasting techniques. 
The primary goal is to predict future customer counts based on historical data using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive 
Integrated Moving Average) model. This README explains the code functionality, data requirements, and steps to run the analysis.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `statsmodels`: For statistical models and hypothesis tests.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tools, specifically for metrics.

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
```

## Data

The analysis uses a CSV file located at `../data/processed/cleaned-data.csv`. The CSV file should contain the following columns:

- **`InvoiceDate`**: The date of the transaction in a recognizable date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- **`CustomerID`**: A unique identifier for customers.

Ensure that the `InvoiceDate` column is properly formatted as dates and `CustomerID` contains valid customer identifiers.

## Code Overview

### Load Data

This section reads the data from the specified CSV file and converts the `InvoiceDate` column to a datetime format. Error 
handling is included to manage potential issues such as file not found or incorrect file format.

```python
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('../data/processed/cleaned-data.csv')
    df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
    print("Error: The file is empty. Please provide a valid data file.")
except pd.errors.ParserError:
    print("Error: The file could not be parsed. Please check the file format.")
```

### Data Extraction and Preprocessing

This step extracts the week number from the `InvoiceDate` and groups the data by week to count unique customers. This weekly 
patronage data is prepared for time series analysis.

```python
df['InvoiceWeek'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.isocalendar().week
patronage_weekly = df.groupby('InvoiceWeek')['CustomerID'].nunique().reset_index()
patronage_weekly = patronage_weekly['CustomerID']
```

### Stationarity Check

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to check if the time series data is stationary. If the data is non-stationary, 
differencing is applied, and the stationarity test is re-run. Error handling ensures that issues with the ADF test are managed.

```python
result = adfuller(patronage_weekly, autolag='AIC')
p_value = result[1]
if p_value <= 0.05:
    d = 0
    data_diff = patronage_weekly
else:
    d = 1
    data_diff = patronage_weekly.diff().dropna()
    result_diff = adfuller(data_diff)
    if result_diff[1] > 0.05:
        d = 2
```

### ACF and PACF Plotting

Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are generated to help determine the appropriate 
ARIMA model parameters. These plots are saved to files and displayed for review.

```python
plot_acf(data_diff)
plot_pacf(data_diff)
plt.show()
```

### ARIMA Model Fitting

An ARIMA model is fitted to the training data, with parameters determined based on previous analysis. Diagnostic plots are generated 
to evaluate the model fit. This helps ensure that the model assumptions are satisfied.

```python
p, d, q = 1, 1, 1
train_data = patronage_weekly[:-4]
test_data = patronage_weekly[-4:]

model = ARIMA(train_data, order=(p, d, q))
results = model.fit()

results.plot_diagnostics()
plt.show()
```

### Forecasting

The fitted ARIMA model is used to forecast future values. The forecast includes predictions and confidence intervals. This forecast 
is compared against the actual data to assess model performance.

```python
forecast = results.get_forecast(steps=len(test_data))
forecast_values = forecast.predicted_mean
forecast_ci = forecast.conf_int()
```

### Plotting Results

The original time series data and the forecasted values are plotted for comparison. This includes a visualization of the forecasted 
range and actual values to evaluate model performance visually.

```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
ax1.plot(patronage_weekly, color='navy')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Customers', fontsize=10)
ax1.set_xticks(range(1, 53))
ax1.grid(True, linestyle='--')
ax1.set_title('Weekly Customer Patronage', fontsize=10)

ax2.plot(patronage_weekly, label='Original', color='olive')
ax2.plot(train_data, label='Observed', color='navy')
ax2.plot(forecast_values, label='Forecast (and range)', color='red')
ax2.fill_between(forecast_ci.index, forecast_ci.iloc[:, 0], forecast_ci.iloc[:, 1], color='pink')
ax2.set_title('Weekly Customer Patronage Forecast Against Original', fontsize=10)
ax2.set_xlabel('Week', fontsize=10)
ax2.set_ylabel('Number of Customers', fontsize=10)
ax2.set_xticklabels(range(1, 53), fontsize=8)
ax2.grid(True, linestyle='--')
ax2.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Model Accuracy

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is calculated to measure the accuracy of the forecast. This metric provides insight into 
how well the model's predictions match the actual data.

```python
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(test_data, forecast_values)
print('MAPE:', mape)
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that your data file is properly formatted and located at `../data/processed/cleaned-data.csv`.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Run the script to perform the forecast analysis. The script will handle data loading, preprocessing, model fitting, forecasting, and visualization.
